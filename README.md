## About This Project

I've had the props for these vehicles for a long time, but never had the skills to bring them to life. After a while, I finally decided to learn how to create something in Garry's Mod. This is my **very first project**.
I believe the props were originally ripped from *Dawn of War 1* by a friend of mine from a community I used to be in.

## ⚠ Bugs / Notes / Creative Liberties ⚠

- Turrets do not turn — models are static; I lack the knowledge to modify models and hope to learn in the future.  
- Weapons are not always accurate to lore.  
- Balance is rough — tweak values yourself if needed.
